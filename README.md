# Graph Query with Inheritance relations

Graph query is to query answers from a heterogeneous information networks with a query graph. We explore hierarchical inheritance
relations between entities and formulate the problem of graph query on heterogeneous information networks with hierarchical inheritance relations. We propose a graph query search algorithm by decomposing the original query graph into multiple star queries and apply a star query algorithm to each star query.
